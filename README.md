# untitled-game

Projects I'm using for this game:

Tinyxml2
https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2

tmxlite
https://github.com/fallahn/tmxlite
https://github.com/fallahn/tmxlite/wiki/Quick-Start

Tiled
https://www.mapeditor.org/

Font
https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Munro

Both Tinyxml2 and tmxlite were built and installed in their own cloned directories (cmake CMakeLists.txt && make install)
Then add the library files generated to lib folder in newnew and link those libraries to newnew.
